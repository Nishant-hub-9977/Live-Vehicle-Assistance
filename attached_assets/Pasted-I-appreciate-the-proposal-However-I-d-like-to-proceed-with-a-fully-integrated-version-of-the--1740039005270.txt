I appreciate the proposal! However, Iâ€™d like to proceed with a **fully integrated** version of the **Roadside Assistance Platform** rather than a simplified MVP. Please ensure that all core functionalities are seamlessly implemented and integrate advanced real-time features from the beginning.

âœ… **Build the complete prototype with all core & advanced features**  
âœ… **Use MERN stack with PostgreSQL as the primary database**  
âœ… **Ensure full compatibility with all screen sizes & devices**  

**ðŸ”¹ Authentication & User Roles:**  
- Implement **Google OAuth 2.0** for authentication instead of basic username/password login.  
- **Three role-based dashboards**: **Clients (Service Takers), Mechanics (Service Providers), and Admin (Superuser).**  
- Admin should have the ability to approve/reject mechanics before they can use the system.  

**ðŸ”¹ Real-Time WebSocket Integration:**  
- Enable **live tracking** of both **clients and mechanics** using **Google Maps API**.  
- Implement **instant status updates** for service requests.  
- Ensure **real-time notifications** when a service request is sent, accepted, or completed.  

**ðŸ”¹ Payment Processing & Secure Transactions:**  
- Integrate **Stripe, UPI, QR Code Payments, and Card Transactions** for seamless service payments.  
- Mechanics should be able to generate a **QR code** for clients to scan and pay securely.  
- Ensure a **detailed transaction history** for both **mechanics and clients**.  

**ðŸ”¹ Offline Mode Support & Syncing:**  
- Clients should be able to **request assistance even when offline**, and their request should sync once online.  
- Ensure **queueing of requests in offline mode** for a smooth user experience.  

**ðŸ”¹ Advanced Tracking & Mechanic Selection:**  
- Enable **live location tracking for both mechanics and clients**.  
- Implement an **intelligent nearest-mechanic selection system** using Google Maps API & distance calculations.  
- Allow clients to **view available mechanics with green dot indicators** for online mechanics.  

**ðŸ”¹ Professional UI/UX with TailwindCSS:**  
- Use **shadcn/ui** and **TailwindCSS** to design a sleek, Uber/Zomato-like interface.  
- Ensure an **interactive and smooth UI/UX** with modern animations & transitions.  

**ðŸ”¹ Database & Backend Infrastructure:**  
- Use **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase) for database management instead of MongoDB.  
- Implement **Prisma ORM** for structured and scalable database interactions.  
- Ensure **secure API authentication** with JWT & role-based access control.  

**Additional Requirements:**  
- **Push Notifications** for real-time updates & alerts.  
- **Service Status Updates** (`Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`) managed by mechanics.  
- **Mechanic Profile Verification** with required documents (Aadhaar, License, Garage Address).  
- **Client Vehicle Details Submission** during service requests.  

ðŸ”¹ **Final Deployment:** Ensure that this project is built with **scalability in mind**, allowing for smooth deployment on **Replit, GitHub Codespaces, and cloud hosting platforms**.

**ðŸ“Œ Proceed with full implementation instead of a limited MVP, integrating all requested functionalities.** ðŸš€
